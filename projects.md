The goal of our lab is to find and fight the causes of Alzheimer's disease and
illuminate the genetic underpinnings of psychological well-being and
psychological resilience.

### Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind how psychological well-being and depression modify AD risk
Psychological well-being (PWB) and depression are important factors that modify
risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, depression is associated with
increased risk for AD while PWB with decreased risk for AD. Molecular mechanisms
underlying these important associations, however, are not known. To address this
knowledge gap, we will study a unique dataset of 850 human postmortem brains
from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. This prospective longitudinal project
annually collects data on depression, PWB, cognition, physical health, and
dementia, and genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC). We will identify key miRNAs, transcripts, and proteins associated with depression, and separately with PWB, and examine how they relate
to cognitive change, AD dementia, and dementia-related pathologies.

### Identifying new Genetic causes of Alzheimer's Disease

- **Identifying New Genetic causes of Early-onset Alzheimer's disease** -
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease is a particularly aggressive form of the disease with higher heritability than typical late-onset AD and has several well-described
genetic causes. We use next-generation sequencing to identify new genetic causes
in families and individuals with this particularly aggressive form of AD.

- **A genetic study of a large pedigree with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease** -
late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, the more common form of the disease, is due to
the cumulative effect of 1,000s or 10,000s of genetic changes. However, there
still appear to be families that transmit the illness as an autosomal dominant
trait. The Emory ADRC has collected a number of very large families and using
linkage and next-generation sequencing techniques we are moving to identify
high-risk alleles in these families.

### A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding Alzheimer's Disease Genome-wide Association Study Results

Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified at least >20
regions of the human genome that are linked with developing AD. Currently, it is
not known why these regions are associated with AD. Our overarching hypothesis
is that some AD GWAS signals are due to one or more coding variants that makes
the translated protein more likely to aggregate. We are uniquely poised to
address this hypothesis given the unique datasets of brain tissue and our
expertise in both large-scale and targeted proteomic analyses. By combining our
genetic sequencing data with cutting-edge mass spectrometry we will sequence
encoded protein products of the same genes from individuals that underwent
genetic sequencing. This will allow us to ask which genetic variants associate
with AD and whether those genetic variants influence the abundance or
aggregation potential of proteins in the brains of individuals with AD.
Furthermore, we have developed a new method to detect and measure novel proteins
that result from genetic sequence variants that cause a change the primary amino
acid sequence. This gives us the ability to directly test whether variant
containing proteins are more or less abundant or aggregation prone in carriers
versus non-carriers and determine whether that contributes to AD risk.
