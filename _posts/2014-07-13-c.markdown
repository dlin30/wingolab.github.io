## packages to get system time

The `<time.h>` header declares the structure `tm`, which includes at least the following members:

    int    tm_sec   seconds [0,61]
	int    tm_min   minutes [0,59]
	int    tm_hour  hour [0,23]
	int    tm_mday  day of month [1,31]
	int    tm_mon   month of year [0,11]
	int    tm_year  years since 1900
	int    tm_wday  day of week [0,6] (Sunday = 0)
	int    tm_yday  day of year [0,365]
	int    tm_isdst daylight savings flag

The perl package `Time::localtime` lets you access this data from perl. Here is the [package](https://metacpan.org/pod/Time::localtime).
