## Many options - all kind of involved

1. [bbcp](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/) is a program that can achieve transfer rates nearly limited by your hardline capacity if you know what you're doing. Some [notes on using bbcp](http://pcbunn.cithep.caltech.edu/bbcp/using_bbcp.htm) might supplement the actual documentation to help you get better speeds. Download source using git:
	`git clone http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/bbcp.git`.

2. [this link](http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/HOWTO_move_data.html) enumerates a number of other options.
