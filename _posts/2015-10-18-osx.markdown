# Get/Set file attributes in OS X

Commands: `GetFileInfo` and `SetFile`

Once I had a folder turned into a package so that every time the folder was
opened it would launch terminal. Not sure how this happened exactly. To solve
this:

```
$ GetFileInfo /path/to/folder
    directory: "/path/to/folder"
    attributes: avBstclinmEdz
    created: 03/17/2015 11:30:57
    modified: 10/18/2015 09:24:30
```

Note the `B` attribute is set indicating that the folder is a "bundle". Change
it back to a folder with `SetFile`.

```
$ SetFile -a b /path/to/folder
```
