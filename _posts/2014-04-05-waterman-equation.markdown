##waterman equation

`s ~ theta * sequence (in bp) * (ln(n-1) + 0.52)`

Where `n = number of chromosomes`.

### common numbers

About `10,000` variants in a single exome (`theta ~ 3e-4`).

About `3 million` variants per genome (`theta ~ 1e-3`); actually less becuase theta for exonic sequence ought to be lower.
