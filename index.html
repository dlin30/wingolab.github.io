  <h1 class="main">A Brief Overview</h1>

  <p>The <b>Wingo Lab</b> is a genetics laboratory at the <a href="http://www.atlanta.va.gov/">Atlanta
    Veterans Administration</a> and <a href="http://www.cnd.emory.edu/">Emory Unversity's Center for
    Neurodegenerative Disease</a> led by Thomas Wingo.</p>

  <p>We study the genetic basis of <b>Alzheimer's Disease</b> and <b>frontotemporal dementia</b>,
    and we are particularly interested in family-based studies and young-onset (also called
    early-onset) Alzheimer's disease.

  <p>We use a combination of <b>next-generation genetic sequencing</b> and <b>proteomic
    sequencing</b> of human brain. These methods require thoughtful setup and are (often)
    computationally intensive to analyze. Generating terabytes of data and using high-performance
    computing clusters, like Emory's Tardis cluster, keeps us on our toes.</p>

  <p>Our work is supported by the Veterans Administration, the National Institutes of
    Health, and Emory University.</p>
