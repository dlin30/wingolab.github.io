## Research Interests

We focus on finding new genetic causes of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Our goal is to find and fight the causes of these illnesses. To do this, we have 3 main focuses:

* **Young-onset Alzheimer's Disease Genetics** - Most of the causes of young-onset Alzheimer's disease (meaning onset on or before 60 years old) are not known. However, about 10% of individuals with young-onset AD (also called early-onset AD) come from families with apparent autosomal dominant transmission of the illness. Of that 10%, about 70-80% are due to mutations in 3 known genes, Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and Presenilin 2 (PSEN2). It is hard to overstate the importance of these mutations on AD research, but what about the remaining 90% without a dominant inheritence? Our work has shown that the remaining 90% also have a strong genetic basis, and the evidence suggests one possible reason is that AD may often be inherited as a [_recessive illness_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21911656). We are currently using samples collected by [Emory ADRC](http://alzheimers.emory.edu/index.html) with next-generation sequencing to identify genes and genetic regions that contribute to this devistating illness.

* **Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease Genetics** - The common form of Alzhiemer's disease has a substantial genetic basis. Unlike young-onset AD, late-onset AD is due to the cumulative effect of 1,000s or 10,000s of genetic changes. However, there still appear to be families that transmit the illness as an autosomal dominant trait. The Emory ADRC has collected a number of very large families and using linkage and next-generation sequencing techniques we are moving to identify high-risk alleles in these families.

* **Proteogenomics** - Predicting the consequences of particular genomic variants is hard to determine. One presumed cause of neurodegenerative illness is that proteins are aggregation prone and that aggregating proteins are deleterious. In collaboration with [Nicholas Seyfried](http://www.biochem.emory.edu/cgi-bin/people/detail_faculty?id=nseyfri) and Duc Duoung at the [Emory Proteomics Core](http://med.emory.edu/research/core_labs/proteomics/index.html) we are merging genetic and proteomic sequencing to address whether variants found in individuals with neurdenerative diseases predisposes the protein to be aggregated in their brain.
