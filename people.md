## **Alumni**

### Adriana Lori, Ph.D.

Dr. Lori received her Ph.D. in Genetic Sciences at the University of Pisa (Italy). Her dissertation focused on identifying chromosomal damages in children exposed to Chernobyl fallout to estimate long-term effects of radiation to the genome. Dr. Lori’s current research involves the role of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in the development of stress-related disorders and social behaviors. Dr. Lori has been one of the primary genetic investigators of the Grady Trauma Project involved in molecular and bioinformatics analyses of sequence variants, GWAS and whole genome sequencing. Dr. Lori joined the Wingo lab in 2018 as a Research Associate.


### Brittney Innocente, B.A.

Ms. Innocente was a research coordinator in 2015-2016 who led Dr. Aliza
Wingo's Genome-wide Association Study of Resilience until its completion
in 2016.

### Jacob Meigs, B.E.

Jacob Meigs received his B.E. in Computer Engineering from the University of South Carolina. His diverse experience extends into web development, software development, and independent web consulting. He joined the Wingo lab in March 2019 and assists in developing and maintaining the lab’s web applications and contributing to the development of tools for general analysis.

### Leo Zhao, B.S.

Leo Zhao received his B.S. in Biology and Music from Emory University. As an undergraduate student, he studied the role of PTPN21 in cell mechanical properties of hematopoietic stem cells, its role in HSCs niche retention and function, as well as its role in leukemogenesis. Leo joined the Wingo lab in 2019 as a Research Specialist.

### Maohua Xie, Ph.D.

Dr. Xie was a Bioinformatic Scientist from 2018-2019. He received his
Master Degree in Analytics at Georgia State University and Ph.D. in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Wuhan University, China. His work
focused on proteogenomic approaches to identifing novel genetic variants
related to AD.

### Melissa Armendariz, B.S.

Ms. Armendariz Ms. Armendariz graduated from Virginia Tech with a
B.S. in Biochemistry and a minor in Chemistry and Psychology. She
was a research coordinator for the Wingo lab from 2016-2019. She
left to work for a private company in Georgia.

### Stephanie Stennett, M.A.

Ms. Stennett was a research coordinator from 2012-2013 who led Dr. Aliza
Wingo's Genome-wide Association Study of Resilience before she moved to
Texas to work for a private company.

### Wen Fan, MS.

Ms. Fan was a biostatistician from 2018-2019 who led the quality
control efforts of brain proteomics data and analysis of large omics
datasets generated by the Wingo Lab and our collaborators. She will
join the joint Biostatistics Ph.D. program of South Methodist
University and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
the Fall of 2022.

### Zoe White, B.S.

Ms. White was a senior research technician from 2012-2017. She performed
targeted capture and next-generation sequencing experiments to identify
new genetic causes of Alzheimer's Disease.
