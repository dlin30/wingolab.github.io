## **Current Members**

### Thomas Wingo, M.D.

I am an Assistant Professor of [Neurology](http://www.neurology.emory.edu/) and [Human Genetics](http://genetics.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/). I am an Atlanta Veterans Administration investigator whose research laboratory is primarily based at the [Center for Neurodegenerative Disease](http://cnd.emory.edu/) in the Whitehead building on Emory's main campus.

I have post-doctoral training in genetics, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics with [David Cutler](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=541). I code in C and Perl, mostly.

I am a board certified neurologist with additional training in cognitive neurology and see patients at the Atlanta VA Memory Clinic.

## **Collaborators**

### [David Cutler, Ph.D.](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=541)

Dave is a population and statistical geneticist, programmer, and happy to help us understand the genetic basis of neurodegenerative illness. He does a lot of work mapping, base-calling, and thinking deeply about the problems of next-generation sequencing.

### [Nicholas Seyfried, DPhil.](http://proteox.genetics.emory.edu/emory/people.html)

Nick is a biochemist and knows about as much as anyone should about mass spectrometry (at least from our perspective). We work closely with him and Duc Duoung developing our proteogenomic project.

### [Michael Zwick, Ph.D.](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=411)

Mike is a population geneticist and shares our interest in using next-generation sequencing to find new genetic targets of human disease.

## **Alumni**

### Eleanor A. Sharp

Ellie examined patterns of Inheritance among families with young-onset AD as part of Emory's [SURE program](http://www.cse.emory.edu/projects/students/sure.html) in the summer of 2012. She is currently a medical student at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
