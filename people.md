## **Current Members**

### Thomas Wingo, M.D.

I am an Assistant Professor of [Neurology](http://www.neurology.emory.edu/) and [Human Genetics](http://genetics.emory.edu/) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/). I am an Atlanta Veterans Administration investigator whose research laboratory is primarily based at the [Center for Neurodegenerative Disease](http://cnd.emory.edu/) in the Whitehead building on Emory's main campus.

I have post-doctoral training in genetics, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics with [David Cutler](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=541). I code in C and Perl, mostly.

I am a board certified neurologist with additional training in cognitive neurology and see patients at the Atlanta VA Memory Clinic.

## **Collaborators**

This is a list of our current collaborators. Just your average collection of geneticist, molecular biologists, neuroscientists, and cognitive neurologists studying neurodegenerative disease together.

### [David Cutler, Ph.D.](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=541)

Dave is a population and statistical geneticist, programmer, and happy to help us understand the genetic basis of neurodegenerative illness. He does a lot of work mapping, base-calling, and thinking deeply about the problems of next-generation sequencing.

### [Peng Jin, Ph.D.](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=124)

Peng is a geneticist interested in trinucleotide repeat disorders, microRNA, and methylation and epigenetic changes as they related to neurodegenerative illnesses. He is particularly interested in Fragile-X associated tremor-ataxia syndrome and G4C2 expanded repeats in C9Orf72 implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. 

### [James Lah, M.D., Ph.D.](http://neurology.emory.edu/faculty/cognitive/lah_james.html)

Jim is a cognitive neurologist, molecular biologist, and neuroscientist interested in RNA splicing and using proteomics to understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We work together on EOAD and proteomics projects.

### [Allan I. Levey, M.D., Ph.D.](http://neurology.emory.edu/faculty/cognitive/levey_allan.html)

Allan is a cognitive neurologist, neuroscientist/neuroanatomist, and many things to many people, but he collaborates with us on EOAD and proteomic projects using human brain tissue.

### [Chadwick Hales, M.D., Ph.D.](http://neurology.emory.edu/faculty/cognitive/hales_chadwick.html)

Chad is another neurocognitive neurologist, neuroscientist, molecular biologist, and electrophsyiologist. We work together on projects to understand pathological accumulation of proteins in the brain and understand how they relate to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. In his spare time he remodels kitchens.

### [Nicholas Seyfried, DPhil.](http://proteox.genetics.emory.edu/emory/people.html)

Nick is a biochemist and knows about as much as anyone should about mass spectrometry (at least from our perspective). We work closely with him and Duc Duoung developing our proteogenomic project.

### [Michael Zwick, Ph.D.](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/faculty.php?facultyid=411)

Mike is a population geneticist and shares our interest in using next-generation sequencing to find new genetic targets of human disease.

## **Alumni**

### Eleanor A. Sharp

Ellie examined patterns of Inheritance among families with young-onset AD as part of Emory's [SURE program](http://www.cse.emory.edu/projects/students/sure.html) in the summer of 2012. She is currently a medical student at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
